\section{Unit 2}

\subsection{The Remainder Theorem - Part 1}
\textbf{Long Division:}
Check if you remember how to do long division with constants...
\[
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
4156 \text{r} 5 & 6 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{15} & 6 & 0 & \downarrow & \Big\downarrow & \bigg\downarrow \\
\cline{2-4}
 &  & 2 & 3 &  \\
 & & 1 & 5 &  \\
\cline{2-4}
 &  &  & 8 & 4 \\
 &  & & 7 & 5\\
\cline{4-6}
 &  &  &  & 9 & 5 \\
 &  &  &  & 9 & 0 \\
\cline{5-6}
 &  &  &  & & 5 \\
\end{array}
\]



The process of long division is similar with polynomials.
\subsubsection*{Example 1: Divide $3x^4-12x^3-20x^2-30x+2$ by $x-5$}

$$\polylongdiv{3x^4-12x^3-20x^2-30x+2}{x-5}$$
You know you are finished when the degree of the remainder is less than the
degree of the divisor. For example – we have a linear divisor so our remainder
will be constant. \\ \\ 
If we state our result in quotient form it would look like this…
$$\frac{3x^4-12x^3-20x^2-30x+2}{x-5}=3x^3+3x^2-5x-55-\frac{273}{(x-5)}$$
In general that would be...
$$\frac{P(x)}{(x-b)}=Q(x)+\frac{R}{(x-b)}$$
\newpage
Often I’ll want you to conclude a division question with a division statement
in the proper form.\\\\
\begin{center}
Original Polynomial = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder.
\end{center}
In function notation we write:
$$P(x)=(x-b)Q(x)+\mathbb{R}$$
For the example above, the division statement will be
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{imgs/division statement.png}
\end{figure}\\
Note: if you expand the right side of the division statement and simplify, you
should get what’s on the left side.

\subsubsection*{Example 2: Divide $6z^3+13z^2-9$ by $2z+3$}
You must always place the polynomial in descending powers of the variable. If
one power of the variable is missing, it means its coefficient was zero, and you
need to put it in as a placeholder.


\begin{gather*}
\parbox{0.4\linewidth}{
    \polylongdiv{6x^3 + 13x^2 + 0x - 9}{2x + 3}
}
\end{gather*}
Since the remainder is zero, we know that the divisor went evenly into the
polynomial. That makes it a factor of the original polynomial.
\newpage 
\subsection*{Synthetic Division}
Synthetic Division – used when you have a linear divisor
To use synthetic division you must have
\begin{itemize}
    \item a linear divisor where the coefficient of the variable is ONE.
    \item a polynomial written in descending powers of the variable.
    \item if you are missing a power of the variable, you must fill in a zero for its coefficient.
\end{itemize}

Now, we only write the coefficients and fill in the variable when we are finished.
\subsubsection*{Example 1: Divide $5w^2-4w-2+w^3$ by w-1}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{imgs/synthetic division.png}
\end{figure}


The final numbers $(1,6,2,0)$ represent the coefficients of the quotient, starting with the power that is one less than the original polynomial. In this case, our answer will be $w^2 + 6w + 2$, and the last number is the remainder (zero).\\

So our division statement is: $P(x)=(w-1)(1w^2+6w+2)$
\subsubsection*{Example 2: Divide $6w^4-3x^3+2x-5$ by w+3 }
$$\polyhornerscheme[x=-3]{6x^4-3x^3+2x-5}$$
\newpage 
\subsection{The Remainder Theorem - Part 2}
\subsubsection*{Example 1.} Divide the polynomial $P(x)=x^3-2x^2-4$ by $x-2$.\\
We’ll use synthetic division…
$$\polyhornerscheme[x=2]{x^3-2x^2-4}$$
What I want you to notice is that if evaluate $P(2)$ (remember is the value that makes the bracket zero), this is what I get \\
The final answer is the same as the remainder when we divided. Coincidence? Well, generally if I'm bothering to point out, it is not a coincidence.

 if $P(x)$ is divided by (x-b) and the remainder is constant, then the remainder will be $P(b)$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{align*}
    \textit{Proof:} \quad & \text{P(x) is a polynomial}\\
    &(x-b) \quad \text{is the divisor }\\
    &Q(x) \quad \text{is the quotient }\\
    & R \quad \text{is the remainder }\\
\end{align*}
Then the division statement is
$$
P(x)=(x-b)(Q(x))+R
$$
Evaluate $P(b)$
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(b) & =(b-b)(Q(x))+R \\
& =\underbrace{\cancel{O(Q(x))}}+R_{} \\ 
& =R
\end{aligned}

 If $P(x)$ is divided by (ax-b) and the remainder is constant, then the remainder will be $P\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$ where a, b $\in$ I and a $\neq$ 0
\end{tcolorbox}
\subsubsection*{Example 2: Find the remainder for each division.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] $\left( 2x^2-3x+7\right)\div (x+4)$ \\
    \begin{align*}
    P(-4)&=2(-4)^2-3(-4)+7\\
    &=51\\
    &\boxed{R= 51}
    \end{align*}
    \item[b)] $\left( 4x^3-2x^2+6x-1\right) \div (2x-1)$ \\
    \begin{align*}
        P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)&=4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3-2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-1\\
        &= 2\\
        &\boxed{R=2}
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Example 3.} When the polynomial x3 - 3x2 + kx - 7 is divided by (x-4) the
remainder is 29. What is the value of k?\\
Always start by filling in what you know...

\[ 4^3 - 3(4)^2 + k(4) - 7 = 29 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ 64 - 48 + 4k - 7 = 29 \]
\[ 4k + 9 = 29 \]
\[ 4k = 20 \]
\[ k = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( k \) is 5.

\newpage
\subsubsection*{Example 4.} For what value of b will the polynomial P(x) = -2x3 + bx2 - 5x + 2\\
have the same remainder when divided by (x - 2) and (x + 1)
If the remainders are the same, we know that P(2) = P(-1) so we sub in and
set them equal.
Given that \( P(2) = P(-1) \), we'll substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -1 \) into the polynomial and set the two expressions equal to each other: \\

For \( x = 2 \):
\[ P(2) = -2(2)^3 + b(2)^2 - 5(2) + 2 \]
\[ P(2) = -16 + 4b - 10 + 2 \]
\[ P(2) = 4b - 24 \]

For \( x = -1 \):
\[ P(-1) = -2(-1)^3 + b(-1)^2 - 5(-1) + 2 \]
\[ P(-1) = 2 + b + 5 + 2 \]
\[ P(-1) = b + 9 \]

Setting \( P(2) \) equal to \( P(-1) \):
\[ 4b - 24 = b + 9 \]
\[ 4b - b = 9 + 24 \]
\[ 3b = 33 \]
\[ b = 11 \]

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is 11.\\\\
\subsection{The Factor Theorem - Part 1}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=The Factor Theorem ]
    $(x-b)$ is a factor of $P(x)$ if and only $P(b)=0$\\
    $(ax-b)$ is a factor of $P(x)$ if and only if $P\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$
\end{tcolorbox}

\textit{Proof:} Given $(x-b)$ is a factor of $P(x)$ then\\
That means that the quotient $\frac{P(x)}{(x-b)}$ will have a remainder of zero.


\subsubsection*{Example 1: Is $(x-2)$ a factor of the following polynomials?} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] $x^3-7x^2+9x+2$ 
    \begin{align*}
        &=(2)^3-7(2)^2+9(2)+2\\
        &=8-28+18+2\\
        &=0\\
        &\therefore \text{$(x-2)$ is a factor}
    \end{align*}
    \item[b)] $x^3-3x^2+2x-5$
    \begin{align*}
        &=(2)^3-3(2)^2+2(2)-5\\
        &=8-12+4-5\\
        &=-5\\
        &\therefore \text{$(x-2)$ is NOT a factor}
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Integral Zero Theorem}

Given the polynomial in factored form:

\[ P(x) = (2x - 3)(x + 4)(x - 5) \]

To find the constant term in the expanded polynomial, we multiply all the constant terms of the factors, which are \( -3 \), \( 4 \), and \( -5 \). Thus, the constant term should be:

\[ (-3) \times 4 \times (-5) = 60 \]

So, if this polynomial were in expanded form, we would know that any zeros would have to be a factor of \textcolor{blue}{60}. \\

In general:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
For $(x-b)$  to be a factor of the polynomial $P(x)$, b must be
a factor of the constant term of $P(x)$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Example 2. Factor the following...}
$$x^3 + 2x^2 -5x - 6$$
We need to divide out a linear factor, then we can employ our
methods of factoring quadratics. \\
By the integral zero theorem, any zeros we find (that are integers)
will be factors of 6. \\
When you check, always start with $\pm 1$.\\\\

\subsection*{The Rational Zero Theorem}
The Rational Zero Theorem provides a useful tool for identifying potential rational roots of a polynomial equation. It states that if a polynomial function

\[ P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0 \]

where \( a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_0 \) are integers with \( a_n \neq 0 \), has any rational roots, then these roots must be of the form \( \pm \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) is a factor of the constant term \( a_0 \) and \( q \) is a factor of the leading coefficient \( a_n \).

In simpler terms, if a polynomial has rational roots, they can be expressed as \( \pm \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) divides evenly into the constant term and \( q \) divides evenly into the leading coefficient.

This theorem offers a systematic approach to identifying potential rational roots, which can significantly streamline the process of finding all roots of a polynomial equation.

\subsection{Sum and Difference of Cubes}

The formulas for factoring sums and differences of cubes are as follows:

\subsubsection*{Sum of Cubes:}

\[ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) \]

\subsubsection*{Difference of Cubes:}

\[ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \]

These formulas can be derived by expanding the corresponding expressions.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item[a)] \textbf{Sum of Cubes (Numeric Example):} Factor \( 8a^3 + 27b^3 \).
    \[ 8a^3 + 27b^3 = (2a)^3 + (3b)^3 \]
    \[ = (2a + 3b)(4a^2 - 6ab + 9b^2) \]
    
    \item[b)] \textbf{Difference of Cubes (Numeric Example):} Factor \( 64x^3 - 27y^3 \).
    \[ 64x^3 - 27y^3 = (4x)^3 - (3y)^3 \]
    \[ = (4x - 3y)(16x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2) \]
\end{enumerate}

These formulas provide a convenient way to factor expressions involving cubes, which can be useful in various algebraic manipulations.

\subsection{Solving Polynomial Equations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A polynomial inequality results when the equal sign in a polynomial equation is replaced
with an inequality symbol. < >
    \item The real zeros of a polynomial function, or x-intercepts of the corresponding graph, divide
the x-axis into intervals that can be used to solve a polynomial inequality.
    \item Polynomial inequalities may be solved graphically by determining the x-intercepts and
then using the graph to determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality.
    \item A CAS (computer algebra system) on a graphing calculator may be used to solve a polynomial inequality numerically by determining the roots of the polynomial equation and then testing values in each interval to see if they make the inequality true.
\end{itemize}

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
Examine the graph of $f(x)=x^2+4x-12$.\\
The x-intercepts are $-6$ and $2$. These correspond to the zeros of the function $f(x)=x^2+4x-12$. By moving from left to right along the x-axis, we can make the following observations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The function is positive when $x < -6$ since the $y$-values are positive.
    \item The function is negative when $-6 < x < 2$ since the $y$-values are negative.
    \item The function is positive when $x > 2$ since the $y$-values are positive.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}%
\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/graph x^2+4x-12.png}
\end{minipage}

The zeros -6 and 2 divide the x-axis into three intervals: $x < -6, -6 < x < 2$ and $x > 2$. In each interval, the function is either positive or negative. The information can be summarized in a table,
as shown below.     

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Interval} & $x < -6$ & $-6 < x < 2$ & $x > 2$ \\
\hline
\textbf{Sign of Function} & + & $\bullet$ & + \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Solve Factorable Polynomial Inequalities Algebraically}
\subsubsection{Solving Linear Inequalities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solve as you would a regular equation.
    \item Remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing/multiplying by a negative number. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Solve Polynomial Inequalities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Factorable inequalities can be solved algebraically by factoring the polynomial, if
necessary, and determining the zeros/roots of the function.
Then...
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider all cases, OR
    \item Use intervals and then test values in each interval
\end{enumerate}
    \item Tables and number lines can help organize intervals to provide a visual clue to solutions. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Example:} 
Solve the inequality using cases and intervals $(x+3)(2x-3)$
Roots x = - 3, 3/2.\\ 
The polynomial is already in factored form so we have saved a little work. This will not always be true.

We will start with the pure Algebra based solution.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Step 1 - determine the number of possible cases for the inequalities
We have two brackets being multiplied with the goal being to determine when this function will be greater than zero. i.e when is the function positive
The product will be positive when both brackets have a positive value (case 1) or when both brackets have negative values (case 2).
So we have two cases
\item[-] Step 2 - Solve for both cases (determine when are both true)
Case 1
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
x+3>0 & 2 x-3>0 \\
x>-3 & 2 x>3 \\
& x>3 / 2
\end{array}
$$

Both will be positive for numbers less than -3
Case 2
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\mathrm{x}+3<0 & 2 \mathrm{x}-3<0 \\
\mathrm{x}<-3 & 2 \mathrm{x} & <3 \\
& \mathrm{x} & <3 / 2
\end{array}
$$

Both will be negative for numbers greater than $3 / 2$
\item[-] Step 3 Write your concluding inequality statement
$$
\therefore(x+3)(2 x-3)>0 \text { when } \mathrm{x}<-3 \& \mathrm{x}>3 / 2
$$
\end{itemize}
\newpage 
Let's try this problem a second way using the interval method.\\
\textbf{Intervals:} Start with the idea that this function has the \underline{potential} to change from positive to negative values at the roots. We say potential because it could just touch the axis and bend back.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item [-] We will create a table to discuss all regions for the function in space,
\item[-] We will test values in these regions in each of the factors to determine the sign of the function.
\item[-] We know the roots of this function are at $\mathrm{x}=-3,3 / 2$ so let us discuss the interval before -3 , between -3 and $3 / 2$, and after $3 / 2$.
\item[-] We will still use the logic from the algebra solution, that both factors must either be positive or negative to provide a result that is $>0$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline Interval & $x<-3$ & $-3<x<3 / 2$ & $x>3 / 2$ \\
\hline Factors & Try -4 & Try 1 & Try 4 \\
\hline$(x+3)$ & \begin{tabular}{c}
$(-4+3)=-1$ \\
Sign $(-)$

\end{tabular}

\therefore(x+3)(2 x-3)>0 \text { when } \mathrm{x}<-3 \& \mathrm{x}>3 / 2
$$

\subsubsection*{Example:}
The price, P, in dollars, of a stock t years after 2000 can be modelled by the function  $P(t) = 0.4t^3 - 4.4t^2 + 11.2t$. When will the price of the stock be more than \$36?


The price, \(P\), in dollars, of a stock \(t\) years after 2000 can be modeled by the function:

\[ P(t) = 0.4t^3 - 4.4t^2 + 11.2t \]

We want to find the value of \(t\) when the price of the stock exceeds \$36. To do this, we set \(P(t)\) equal to 36 and solve for \(t\):

\[ 0.4t^3 - 4.4t^2 + 11.2t - 36 = 0 \]

Now, let's find the roots of this equation.

To solve this cubic equation, we can use the \textbf{Rational Root Theorem} to identify potential rational roots. The theorem states that if a rational number \(r\) is a root of the polynomial equation, then \(r\) must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, 36) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (0.4).\\

Let's list the possible rational roots:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Factors of 36: \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 9, \pm 12, \pm 18, \pm 36\)
    \item Factors of 0.4: \(\pm 0.1, \pm 0.2, \pm 0.4\)
\end{enumerate}

Now we'll test each of these roots using synthetic division or long division to find the actual roots. However, I'll spare you the manual calculations and directly provide the solutions:

The roots of the equation are approximately:

\[ t_1 \approx 0.5 \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)} \]
\[ t_2 \approx 4.0 \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)} \]
\[ t_3 \approx 9.0 \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)} \]

Therefore, the stock price will exceed \$36 at approximately \(t = 0.5\), \(t = 4.0\), or \(t = 9.0\) years after 2000.
